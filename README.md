# MA5232 Project 1 HUANG LINHANG
The repository is dedicated to the project for the NUS module MA5232 coordinated by Professor Bao Weizhu. The codes might not be well-commented as they only serves for the purpose of answering assigned questions. The author is not responsible for the potential consequences of using the codes. Note that the author was writing the algorithms without enough knowledge of relavant, well-studied libraries in Julia. Therefore, it is highly likely that the codes are not optimised very well. Thanks for understanding.
